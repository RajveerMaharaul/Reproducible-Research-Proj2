## Sysnopis
This is an R Markdown document which is used to analyze the [Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) based on the [National Weather Service Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf). The document is focus in answering the two question which are:

    1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

    2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences? 

The basic goal of this document is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and understand some basic concepts about weather events.

## Data Processing

Set the working directory:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
my.path <- "C:/temp"
setwd(my.path)
```

Downloading data from the website:
[Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)

or you can download file using the file URL
```{r, echo=TRUE}
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
fileZip <- "./repdata-data-StormData.csv.bs2"
if (file.exists(fileZip) == F) {
    download.file(fileUrl, fileZip, method="wget")
}
```

Reading data from the raw file:
```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
data <- read.csv(bzfile("repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2"), header = TRUE, sep=",")
```

## Question 1: Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

Find the most harmful with respect to population health by FALITIES and INJURIES variable
```{r, echo=TRUE}
harm <- data$FATALITIES + data$INJURIES
maxharm <- max(harm)
maxharm
```

Subsetting data to find the most harmful with respect to population health
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mostharm <- data$EVTYPE[which(data$INJURIES + data$FATALITIES == maxharm)]
mostharm
```

## Question 2: Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Property Damage estimate in Billion dollar
```{r, echo=TRUE}
prop <- data$PROPDMG[which(data$PROPDMGEXP == "B")]
prop
```

The maximum property damage:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- max(prop)
a
```

Crop Damage estimate in Billion dollar
```{r, echo=TRUE}
crop <- data$CROPDMG[which(data$CROPDMGEXP == "B")]
crop
```

The maximum property damage:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
b <- max(crop)
b
```

We can clearly see that the property damage is 115 billion dollar, which is the the largest amount.

The type of event which creates the greatest economic consequences:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
econ <- data$EVTYPE[which((data$PROPDMG == a) & (data$PROPDMGEXP == "B"))]
econ
```
## Plotting

Number of injuries and fatalities caused by Storm
```{r, echo=TRUE}
tornado <- data[which(data$EVTYPE == "TORNADO"),]
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=tornado, aes(x=EVTYPE, y=total_human_cost)) +
geom_bar(colour="black", stat="identity") +
xlab ("Event type") + ylab ("Fatalities + Injuries") +
theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.3)) +
ggtitle ("Total human cost by event type")
```

The Property Damage caused by Flood
```{r, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(data$PROPDMG[data$EVTYPE=="FLOOD"]
        , main ="Property Damage caused by Flood"
        ,xlab="FLOOD", ylab="Billions of Dollar")
```

## Results

Question 1: Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mostharm <- data$EVTYPE[which(data$INJURIES + data$FATALITIES == maxharm)]
mostharm
```

The answer is TORNADO.

Question 2: Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
econ <- data$EVTYPE[which((data$PROPDMG == a) & (data$PROPDMGEXP == "B"))]
econ
```

The answer is FLOOD.
